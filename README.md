# Linear Algebra

This project is an introduction to linear algebra concepts using Python and NumPy. It covers fundamental operations on vectors and matrices, including slicing, transposition, element-wise operations, concatenation, and matrix multiplication.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to explain:

- What is a vector?
- What is a matrix?
- What is a transpose?
- What is the shape of a matrix?
- What is an axis?
- What is a slice?
- How do you slice a vector/matrix?
- What are element-wise operations?
- How do you concatenate vectors/matrices?
- What is the dot product?
- What is matrix multiplication?
- What is Numpy?
- What is parallelization and why is it important?
- What is broadcasting?

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.9)
- Files will be executed with `numpy` (version 1.25.2)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Code should follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.11.1)
- All modules, classes, and functions should have documentation
- Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using `wc`
